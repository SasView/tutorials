This repository is where contributed tutorials for SasView live!

At the time of writing, nothing further is done with the pdf files. 
So they must be manually copied to:

- The /downloads folder of the website
  - so they are available from http://www.sasview.org/links.html 
  
- The SasView /src/sas/sasview/media folder
  - so they are distributed in the SasView installer /media folder

- The SasView /docs/sphinx-docs/source-temp/user/sasview folder
  - so they are available from the SasView help documantation
